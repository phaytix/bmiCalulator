# Body Mass Index Calculator

This is just a project I made to mess around and learn tkinter.
But I also wanted to see the work with BMI considering the United States Obesity problem.

I do want to turn this into a website eventually but right now an app is fine unless you want to go ahead and work on a website for this.

Also the problem with COVID-19 and obesity and it'd be cool to add who's at a
higher risk

Adding something about what happens to your body while you have covid and after would be cool too

This is a lot but adding a graph would be pretty cool too so if you'd like that add it, if
not I'll probably end up adding one sooner or later.

## Modules
* !pip install tkinter



## Stuff to add 
* Id like to add a conversion from kg and cm to lbs and ft and inches if possible if not whatever I guess, not that big of a deal all we'd have to add is a conversion site or
something.
* Possibly turn into website for easier accessability because nobody wants to download an app honestly so.
* Probably should add more health stuff/links to help people if they're actually trying to lose weight
* Sleek minimalist design for GUI
* Obviously find and use credible links like the CDC and make sure to credit those sources
