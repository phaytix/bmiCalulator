# fix button so its at the bottom instead of at the top
# see if you can add 2 separate files "board.py" and import into "main.py" for the WIDTH
# and HEIGHT of the board
# or just add into "frame" 
# --------------------------------------------
# add entry for wight(kg) and height(cm)
# MAYBE add a link for kg and cm to inches and pounds for conversion
# add title to window "Body Mass Index Calculator"
# add links
# add a page or health links since this is a health app or website then again if this does 
# turn into a website id like to have way more stuff but for the most part what we have
# should be fine
# I also don't really care about design that much besides for a minimalism aspect of the
# app or website i just want it clean and sleek
